# Learning Process  

## Q1. What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.  
If you are able to explain the concept to any person with other backgrounds and make them understand, then you are a master of it.  

## Q2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?  
The interesting story is that even Thomas Alva Edison used to have a barring in his hand used to think about the problem, and used to fall asleep as soon as he did the baring would fall off his hand and wake him up, and used his fresh mind to solve the problem.  

## Q3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?  
1. **Active/Focused mode of thinking** is when you set time aside to think about the problem deeply, which is mainly used for known similar kinds of problems.  
2. **Diffused mode of thinking** is that after thinking about the problem for a while then take a break or rest so that your mind comes out of that mindset and new ideas creep into it. Then apply those new ideas to the thinking about the problem again.  

## Q4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.  
1. Deconstruct the skill  
2. Learn enough to self-correct  
3. Remove practice barriers  
4. Practice at least 20 hours  

## Q5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?  
1. I like to implement the Feynman technique in my life as it would be game-changing one.  
2. Making the process of learning more enjoyable.  
3. Work when you and play when you play.  
4. I would like to keep track of the time so that I can dedicate more time to the learning process.
